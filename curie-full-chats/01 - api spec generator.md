create a to-do task management application api spec. make sure to include all crud operations for the tasks

## 2. Curie

Great! To design a To-Do Task Management API, I need a few clarifications:

1. Do you want the specification in YAML or JSON format? (YAML is recommended for readability and Mulesoft compatibility.)
2. Should tasks be associated with users (i.e., multi-user support), or is it a simple single-user task list?
3. Do you require authentication (e.g., API Key, OAuth2), or should the API be open?
4. Any specific fields you want for a task? (e.g., title, description, due date, status, priority)
5. Should there be support for filtering or searching tasks (e.g., by status or due date)?

Once you provide these details, Iâ€™ll generate a complete, validated OpenAPI 3.0 specification for your To-Do Task Management API.

## 3. Alex

1. yaml 
2. simple single user task list 
3. no 
4. title, description, due date, status
5. yes

## 4. Curie

Here is a complete, validated OpenAPI 3.0 YAML specification for a simple single-user To-Do Task Management API with full CRUD operations and support for filtering tasks by status and due date. No authentication is required.

## 5. Alex

make sure you're using restful best practices

## 6. Curie

Here is your To-Do Task Management API specification, following RESTful best practices:

- Resource-oriented URIs (/tasks, /tasks/{taskId})
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Proper use of status codes (200, 201, 204, 404)
- Filtering via query parameters
- Clear, noun-based resource naming
- No verbs in URIs
- All schemas and parameters are clearly defined

You can import this YAML directly into your Mulesoft project.

Let me know if you need further customization or examples!

## 7. Alex

- taskcreate and taskupdate are redundant because it's doing the same thing. please use only one
- change the `status` to be `completed` and make it a boolean. default value should be false

## 8. Curie

Here is your updated To-Do Task Management API specification, following RESTful best practices and your latest requirements:

- Only one input schema (TaskInput) is used for both create and update.
- The status is now a boolean field named completed, with a default value of false.
- Filtering supports completed (boolean) and dueDate (date).
- All CRUD operations are present and resource-oriented.

This specification is fully valid and ready for use in your Mulesoft project. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

## 9. Alex

the example values shouldn't have quotes cause it'll cause issues with the preview in api console
